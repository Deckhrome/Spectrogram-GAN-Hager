# GAN-Hager

This Python code is designed to extract data from zip files, convert `.mat` files into spectrograms for training GAN models, and generate new samples, with the ability to convert the generated images back into `.mat` format.

This project was proposed by Hager Group and developed by a group of students from Telecom Physique Strasbourg.
